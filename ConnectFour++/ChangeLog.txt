Updated:
	- Board to now properly handle if the game gets to the max number of turns. 42 is the magic number!

Changed: 
	- Division by 2. Now uses bitshift. Feel the speed.
	- No more warnings! I know you'll miss them.

Added: 
	- The player can now use the numerical input for the counter. Even their numerical keypad. Awesome.

TODO: 
	- Add hover effects to the buttons.
	- Save all of the settings to a document and allow for the user to change it. 
	- After a move is made, check where the mouse currently is.
