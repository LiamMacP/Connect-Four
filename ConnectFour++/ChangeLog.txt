Updated:
	- Board Sprite and Mask: Bigger so scales better. Plus more detail! Everyone loves detail.
	- Counter Sprite: Bigger so scales better. Plus more detail! The bigger the better they say.

Changed: 
	- Size of counter made smaller so doesn't look silly.
	- X Position for in board. New counter showed bad offsetting.
	- Get rid of messageboxes altogether. They're not user friendly, who says I don't think about you!

Added: 
	- Added constants header file. Refactoring code for readability. Not that you want to read it. [Nothing in it yet. Its the thought that counts]
	- Added prototypes header file. Bored of seeing them all.
	- Added Main Menu for user to be able to choose whether not they want to play AI or user.
	- New game button to the game so you can restart if you feel your losing. 

TODO: 
	- Add hover effects to the buttons.
	- Save all of the settings to a document and allow for the user to change it. 
	- After a move is made, check where the mouse currently is.
	- Fix the nice 21 Warnings.
